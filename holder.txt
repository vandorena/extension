I love getting people excited to go out sailing. 
The sport has been such a large part of my life, and I relish the opportunity to share 
that part of me that’s usually hidden away miles offshore.

Early in my High School experience, before my commitment to competitive 
sailing stole away lots of my free time, I would voluntarily spend large 
amounts of my time teaching children how to sail. Throughout the summers 
I would volunteer as an Assistant Instructor (AI) at Oxford Sail Training 
Trust and during term time I would assist in coaching my school's novice 
sailing club. Being an AI was a changing experience for me, it was the first
 time I’d ever had anything resembling a job, and I’d often arrive home drained
  from the daily 9 hours of childcare. Yet the feeling of contentI felt each 
  day as I left the sailing club still stays with me. I’m glad it presented 
  daily challenges, at one point pushing me to my breaking point, and I 
  believe that this was important to my personal growth, further developing
   my character.
